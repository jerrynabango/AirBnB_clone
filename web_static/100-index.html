				Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guests house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown, the Fair Grounds (Jazz Fest) and City Park.
				The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious.
				The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck  to relax on and hav a glass of Merlot.

							Fantastic place. It was clean. Adrienne was great (even though we did not meet in person) and everything went super smooth.
							Location is also great if you like running and something is a bit more quiet.
							I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location.
							Overallm, would recommend the place anyttime.
